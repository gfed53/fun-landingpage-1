# Aptiplex

A landing page for a fictitious company.

## Introduction

I wanted to create a simple landing page since the majority (perhaps even all..) of my work has been web apps, particularly in AngularJS. This landing page would allow me to both show off and sharpen my design skills, and have another go at the 'Bootstrap-less' way of development.

## The Process

For libraries, I used jQuery along with Velocity.js for animations and Fallings.js for parallax scrolling. 

For layout, I got more comfortable with Flexbox and learned a thing or three about cross-browser compatibility, especially when it comes to cutting edge technologies.

For animations, I got more comfortable with Velocity.js as well as CSS3 animations/keyframes/transitions. During the development I actually created the same animations through different implementations to get more experience and also find which techniques offered the most options, flexibility, ease of use, and best performance. There seem to be tradeoffs between them.

For my styles in general, I used the actual Sass syntax (not SCSS) for the first time and now prefer the bracket-less, semicolon-less, indented way of doing things. Through my build-task, I got some experience with CSS autoprefixers.
